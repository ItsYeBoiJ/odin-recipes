        <p>This baked ziti is always a hit! A lady I worked with brought this in one day, and everyone loved it.</p>
        <p>Now it is the favorite of all my dinner guests. </p>
        <p>I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound dry ziti pasta</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>1 Â½ cups sour cream</li>
            <li>6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 of the ziti in the bottom of the prepared dish; top with Provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/2 of the meat sauce, remaining ziti, mozzarella cheese, and remaining meat sauce. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheeses have melted, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
